# Wallet
A secure wallet to store and use cryptographic credentials. Should be compatable with both Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. (and potentially more!).

## Timeline:

### October 18:

- Wallet generates public/private keys compatible with either Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains

### October 23:

- Uses Keccak_256 to generate an Ethereum address given the public key



## Future Development:

- Unit tests to take in a known valid pub/priv/address pair and guarantee the generation works

- Password encryption/decryption of stored private keys
